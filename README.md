# toy02_tms

This repository contains a simple setup with a Node.js backend and a React frontend. Both are placed in separate folders:

- **backend/**: A basic Express server.
- **frontend/**: A minimal React application configured with webpack and Babel.

Each folder contains its own `package.json` with the required dependencies and scripts.
